The bean market is very oversold and those who have beans yet to sell are hopeful of a turn around and continued China demand into the new year.\nA significant rally may be a challenge as favorable weather has South American crop projections ballooning.

        "all_text": "The Trump administration has tapped Spokane County’s top spokesman to hold the highest U.S. Department of Agriculture role in Washington state.\nSpokane County Communications Director Patrick Bell on Tuesday was named director of the Washington office of the USDA’s Farm Service Agency, which oversees federal farm loans, disaster assistance and conservation programs statewide from its headquarters in Spokane Valley.\nBell has nearly 20 years of experience in the communications and political realms, including as associate and interim director of state relations and director of special projects for the University of Washington. He’s likely best known for his eight years as a senior staff member for former Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a Republican from Spokane, including managing a re-election campaign and her three Eastern Washington offices. He joined the county in 2023 and unsuccessfully ran for a state House of Representatives seat from his home in Suncrest in 2024.\nMcMorris Rodgers said Bell’s selection was a great choice for the state of Washington. He brings lived experience, as well as a hefty knowledge of federal operations and established relationships within the agricultural community, nationally and statewide.\n“I think he has a ton to offer,” She said. “And besides his knowledge and experience, he also just has a great big heart. He really cares about people and wants to help.”\nBell is someone who understands the challenges facing Washington’s agricultural comm",

        "all_text": "Homebuyers looking to lock in a 0% down payment loan will find themselves with two options: a Veterans Affairs loan and a United States Department of Agriculture loan.\n“Zero down loans exist because the down payment is often the biggest barrier to homeownership, not the monthly payment,” Steven Parangi, loan expert with Alpine Mortgage Services, tells Realtor.com®. “When structured properly, these loans can be a stepping stone allowing borrowers to build equity, strengthen credit, and move into more traditional financing options down the road.”\nVA and USDA loans are government-backed programs with specific qualification criteria. However, credit scores still play a role because the government does not fund the loans—private lenders do, and they are the ones who assess your finances.\nA USDA loan does not have a minimum credit score set by the federal agency, but lenders may require a score of at least 580 to 620. These loans are insured by the USDA and are meant for low- and moderate-income homebuyers who want to buy a home in a rural area.\nThe U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has no minimum credit score either, but lenders who provide VA loans usually require a score of 620 or higher. VA loans were created for eligible members of the military and other eligible beneficiaries.\n“VA technically has no minimum, but in real underwriting, most approvals cluster around 620, and some lenders will go to the high 500s if the file is otherwise clean, stable income, low revolving debt",

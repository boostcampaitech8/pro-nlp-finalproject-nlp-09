It pauses the Dec. 16 demands by the USDA, which ordered Minnesota to interview within a month around 100,000 households to verify their eligibility for the program.\nFederal officials vowed to cut SNAP funding across Minnesota if state officials failed to meet those demands, threatening to stop food supplies for an estimated 440,000 Minnesotans who receive SNAP benefits each month. Nearly half of the program’s recipients are children.\n“We have won yet another battle in the Trump administration’s war on Minnesota,” Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said in a statement. “Before any of us in the state are Republicans or Democrats, we are Minnesotans, and it should shock and disgust us that this president is trying to take food off the table of half a million of our neighbors.”\nVolunteers and aid groups scrambled to feed residents across Minnesota as federal officials announced aid would dry up, leaving people at risk of going hungry vulnerable.

The waiver would ban food stamp benefits from being used to purchase candy and soft drinks, as defined by lawmakers.\n\"The goal and purpose of this waiver is to promote healthier eating habits among participants, supporting improved outcomes and reducing diet-related conditions by encouraging the use of SNAP benefits for more nutritious food options,\" said Kansas documents about the requested waiver. \"These waivers are a key",

For Dr. Sattele, founder of Rapid Weight Loss Centers, these guidelines reflect many of the same science-based nutrition principles that have helped thousands of patients achieve meaningful, lasting weight loss since he established his practice over 20 years ago.\n\"Long before these national recommendations were issued, we were helping patients lose weight and improve their health using whole foods, proper protein intake, and medical supervision,\" Dr. Sattele explains. \"The new federal guidelines align with much of what we've seen work consistently: when you prioritize nutrient-dense, minimally processed foods, your body responds with sustainable weight loss and improved metabolic health.\"\nA Philosophy Ahead of Its Time\nWhile many commercial weight loss programs have historically relied on prepackaged sha",

It was previously unclear whether the toxic metals came from the soil or the fertilizers applied. Under the leadership of the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ) and Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, a research team has examined wheat grains to clarify the question.\nUsing a special isotope signature, they found that most of the toxic metals come from the mineral fertilizer. A combination of mineral and organic fertilization would not only reduce the concentration of toxic metals but also increase the concentration of metals important for human nutrition. The researchers reach this conclusion in their study published in Environment International.\n\"From field and greenhouse studies, it is known that the type of fertilization—i.e. mineral or organic—has an influence on the metal concentration in crops,\" says Prof. Dr. Marie Muehe, head of the Plant Biogeochemistry working group at the UFZ and co-leader of the study. \"But until now, it was not known whether the metals absorbed by the plants came from the soil or directly from the fertilizers.\" This is what the German–American research team aimed to find out with their current study.\nThe scientists used soil samples and wheat grains from the static fertilization experiment at the UFZ research station in Bad Lauchstädt.

The USDA says in the accounting year that ended on Sept. 30, 2024, SNAP cost just over $100 billion, providing an average of $190.59 a month per person to over 42 million people.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) oversees the program and says it is working on a major overhaul to root out waste, fraud, and abuse.\nBy the numbers:\nDuring the federal government shutdown, the SNAP program came under scrutiny when funding came close to running out. The USDA says in the accounting year that ended on Sept. 30, 2024, SNAP cost just over $100 billion, providing an average of $190.59 a month per person to over 42 million people. The average monthly benefit per household is $356.21 according to data from the USDA.\nDig deeper:\nThe federal government funds SNAP and sends the money to the states, which administer applications and determine eligibility based on federal guidelines. Benefits are loaded on prepaid cards through the Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) system and beneficiaries use the cards at stores to pay for their groceries.\nLast month, citing data from 29 states that complied with the USDA's request for information, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said 186,000 deceased men and women and children are receiving SNAP benefits and there are 356,000 duplicate enrollments.\nThe USDA has since pledged to root out fraud within the program and is requiring participants to reapply for benefits.\nNew SNAP requirements take effect for recipients\nThe Trump administration’s new requ",

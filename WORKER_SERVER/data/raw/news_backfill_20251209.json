Bill Lee said during the Tennessee Farm Bureau’s annual meeting in Franklin on Tuesday.\nUp to $11 billion in federal funding will be used for the Farmer Bridge Assistance program, which will provide relief payments to farmers who produce specific row crops, including soybeans, corn, cotton, and other crops widely grown in Tennessee.\nThe remaining $1 billion will be reserved for specialty crops, sugar, and other commodities not covered in the Farmer Bridge Assistance program, but the distribution timeline for that funding is “still under development” and will “require additional understanding of market impacts and economic needs,” according to the USDA.\nPayments will be based on planted acres.\nFarmers have until Dec. 19 at 5 p.m. ET to ensure their 2025 acreage reporting is accurate, and the USDA will announce the payment rate by crop the week of Dec. 22, according to Alison Slagell, senior policy advisor to the USDA secretary.\nProducers must certify that their adjusted gross income is less than $900,000 to be eligible. The program will limit payments to up to $155,000 per person or legal entity, according to USDA Undersecretary Richard Fordyce. Produc",

The bailout itself is also seen by many as a tacit admission by the White House that the U.S. economy is not where it needs to be — despite what Trump and his minions keep insisting.\nAlmost a year out from the end of Joe Biden’s presidency, the Trump administration is under increasing pressure to take action to lower the cost of living for American families who remain largely unsatisfied with the progress made so far.\nAnd that pressure continues to manifest itself in Trump and his cabinet’s seeming obsession with Biden — both as a point of blame and as a basis of comparison whenever confronted on their own shortcomings.\nWhile the president’s team touts marginally lower gas prices that are still just under an average of $3 a gallon nationwide, grocery prices, energy prices and housing costs continue to soar and millions of younger Americans fear they have been priced out of the homebuyer’s market altogether.\nAt the center of discussions about the Trump economy is the president’s trade policy.

        "all_text": "WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Agriculture is reminding travelers not to bring pork products into the country this holiday season, citing continued concerns about African swine fever.\nThe warning applies to travelers coming to the U.S. mainland from Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and international destinations. The USDA has maintained a protection zone around Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to prevent spread of the highly contagious disease.\nSince 2021, more than 240,000 pounds of pork products have been seized from flights originating in Puerto Rico, according to the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS).\n\"Remember, pigs don't fly - not even for the holidays!\" the agency posted on X.\nAfrican swine fever is a viral disease that affects domestic and wild pigs but does not infect humans. The disease can have a fatality rate of up to 100% in infected swine, and there is no treatment or vaccine available. The only way to control an outbreak is to kill all affected and exposed pigs.\n\"Although it is not a direct threat to human health, its deadly nature in swine could result in pork product shortages, disruptions to trade, and economic impacts,\" APHIS says on its website.\nThe disease has never been reported in the United States, but its reintroduction in the Dominican Republic and Haiti in recent years poses a \"serious threat to our pork industry,\" according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\nThe threat has intensified following a recent outbreak",

Scroll for who benefits next.\nThe U.S. government will send $12 billion in financial aid to American farmers struggling from recent trade disruptions. The Trump administration confirmed that up to $11 billion of the $12 billion package will go directly to row-crop producers through a newly created Farmer Bridge Assistance Program. This program is built to deliver rapid support to farms reporting significant price and yield losses linked to trade-driven market swings.\nThe remaining portion of the package—about $1 billion—will cover specialty crops and other commodities that fall outside core row-crop categories. Officials noted that allocations for these sectors are still being finalized but will prioritize farms showing measurable declines in income tied to disrupted trade flows.\nThe payments aim to provide a short-term bridge for farmers while trade deals and economic policies stabilize the sector. Eligible crops include soybeans, corn, cotton, and other major row crops. Farmers will receive one-time checks calculated based on acreage, crop type, and production expenses.\nRecent trade tensions, especially with China, cut U.S. exports sharply. Soybean farmers were hit during critical harvest periods. Rising cost",

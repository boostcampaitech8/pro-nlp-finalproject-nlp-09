A shipment of nearly 58,000 metric tons of yellow corn harvested in Minnesota and the Dakotas arrived at Chattogram port Tuesday, according to a statement from the US embassy in Dhaka. The last time Bangladesh imported corn from the United States was in 2018.\nIn 2024, Bangladesh moved away from India, once its largest supplier of corn, and shifted to South American exporters such as Brazil and Argentina. In 2023, Bangladesh imported the most corn from India, valued at USD 171 million, but in 2024-25, Brazil accounted for 93 per cent of the country’s corn imports, followed by Argentina at 4 per cent and Pakistan at 2 per cent.\nThe renewed US imports now come as Dhaka and Washington seek to recalibrate trade ties amid a widening bilateral trade gap. Washington recently reduced its reciprocal tariff rate on Bangladeshi goods to 20 per cent, down from an initial 37 per cent, after Dhaka agreed to increase imports from the US, part of efforts to narrow an annual trade deficit exceeding 6.2 billion dollars.\nWestward shift\nCorn is important for Bangladesh’s feed and livestock industry, and despite being the country’s second-largest grain crop after rice, domestic production falls far short of demand, reports noted.\nThe shipment that landed on 1 January comprised around 58,000 metric tons of corn sourced from North Da",

This followed the release of more than Rs 300 crore in November as the first instalment to 1.32 lakh farmers. The payments marks Madhya Pradesh’s second rollout of the BBY, also known as the Price Deficiency Payment Scheme (PDPS), which aims at ensuring farmers receive minimum support price (MSP) while selling in the open market. BBY was first launched in 2017 for eight crops, including soybean, groundnut, and pulses such as pigeon pea, but was later discontinued.\nIn an interaction with ET Digital, Nishant Warwade, Secretary, Farmers Welfare and Agriculture Development Department, Madhya Pradesh, outlines how the state is strengthening the Bhavantar scheme to ensure benefits reach farmers more effectively. He also talks about fertiliser shortages and rising stubble burning in the state and more. Edited excerpts:\nThe Economic Times (ET): How effective has the Bhavantar scheme been? The scheme has faced criticism due to payment delays and compensation based on a model price instead of the farmer’s actual sale price, which often puts small farmers at a di",

They share similar growing regions, compete for acreage, and are influenced by many of the same macro forces—weather, input costs, and global demand. Yet despite these similarities, their prices often diverge in meaningful and predictable ways. That divergence is where relative value comes into play. By focusing not on the outright direction of prices, but on how corn and wheat move relative to each other, traders can uncover spread opportunities that exist throughout the year—often independent of whether grain prices are rising or falling.\nUnderstanding the Corn–Wheat Relationship\nCorn and wheat serve overlapping but distinct roles in the global agricultural system.

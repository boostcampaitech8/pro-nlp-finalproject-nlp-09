        "all_text": "Bhikangaon (Madhya Pradesh): Farmers from eight villages of Bhikangaon in Khargone district threatened to go on an indefinite strike if irrigation water from the Binjalwada project is not released by January 5.\nRashtriya Kisan Majdoor Mahasangh, on Friday, organised a meeting at Krishi Upaj Mandi and later submitted a memorandum to the SDM. The organisation demanded immediate water release, transparent cotton procurement and timely compensation of soybean crop.\nAs per reports, the delay in the implementation of the project and intermittent water supply has put Rabi crops, including wheat and gram, at risk of drying up. Affected villages include Aman Khedi, Temla, Palasi, Pipliya, Chikalwas, Shivna-Kewati river pond, Mohan Khedi and Jamnya.\nAccording to farmers, the water, once released, is frequently stopped for repairs. They also raised concerns about CCI cotton procurement and claimed that due to rejected consignments and weighing irregularities, they are facing financial losses. Their plight is further aggravated by non-payment of compensation due to soyabean crop loss in Bhikangaon and Jhirniya.\nThe memorandum was submitted by leaders including president Hosilal Yadav, Shivpal Chauhan, Nana Patwaria and Lakhan Patel. The federation warned that failure to address these demands will trigger an indefinite protest in front of the SDM office.",

        "all_text": "Authored by Zachary Stieber via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),\nUndercover investigators with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) are going to check whether stores are complying with new restrictions on food stamps, the department said in a new notice to state and regional officials.\nThe USDA’s Office of Retailer Operations and Compliance carries out federal oversight of retailers that accept funds from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), colloquially known as food stamps. The office “initiates and conducts undercover investigations to determine if a retailer is complying with program requirements,” the USDA said in the Dec. 30, 2025, notice.\nOnce new SNAP restrictions take effect in states, investigators “will incorporate attempts to purchase restricted items according to the state’s SNAP Food Restriction policy, beginning 90 days after the implementation date,” the notice states.\nRetailers that are not in compliance will initially receive a warning letter advising corrective action. If retailers are found to be out of compliance again, then officials will revoke their authorization to keep accepting SNAP.\nUSDA Secretary Brooke Rollins in 2025 approved requests from 18 states to diverge from normal SNAP operations and impose various restrictions on which items participants can buy.\nThe first five states—Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska, Utah, and West Virginia—began restricting purchases on Jan. 1. The next restrictions take effect in Idaho, Louisiana, and Ok",

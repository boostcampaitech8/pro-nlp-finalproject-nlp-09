Watch the full interview here.\nMichelle Rook: Welcome to Markets Now. I'm Michelle Rook with Darin Newsom, Senior Market Analyst with Barchart. We are seeing higher grains this morning, some pressure over in the livestock. Darin, let's start off talking about the grains. The rally that we're seeing this morning, how much of this is fund rebalancing, either hedge funds or index funds here, as we start a new year?\nDarin Newsom: Yes, that's an interesting question, Michelle, because it certainly could be. The thing that we have to keep in mind, though, is that these same funds were already long, corn and soybeans at the end of 2025. We came into 2026, and they were still holding net long futures positions. One can make the argument that if they were rebalancing and they were moving over to other markets that potentially had a more bullish fundamental picture longer-term, then we would actually be seeing increased pressure. I think there's possibly some activity.\nThere's obviously some activity coming from the non-commercial side. If so, it seems to be under the guise, or it has all of the characteristics of commercial buying. To me, this argument makes just as much sense. We broke soybeans so hard over the previous few weeks, what, $1.50 or something like that, and we just dragged it down to le",

Troy Romero’s appointment as Louisiana’s state director for rural development, where he’ll lead efforts to secure resources for rural communities.\nThe main task of the job is to connect people and businesses in rural areas with financial resources like grants and low-interest and guaranteed loans, Romero said.\nHe gave as an example the $27 billion Meta data center project in Richland Parish in northeast Louisiana.\n“All of the communities that surround it are going to need to be built up,” Romero said. “They’re going to need, you know, extra hospital space and rural clinics and restaurants.”\nUSDA’s rural development section supports economic development, job creation and services like housing, health care, first-responder services and utility infrastructure, according to its website.\nRomero resigned from his seat in the Louisiana Legislature on Dec. 14 and began his new job with the federal government the next day, he said.\nHe’s replacing acting Director MaryAnn Pistilli and will be based in Alexandria, though he’ll regularly travel the state and meet with local leaders and officials, he said.\nThe former state lawmaker said Gov. Jeff Landry helped put his name forward for the appointment.\nRomero was first elected to the Legislature in 2019 and ran again in 2023 unopposed.

        "all_text": "On Wednesday Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and the U.S. Department of Agriculture released new official guidance that effectively overturns the food pyramid. The recommendations encourage Americans to eat “real food” and to consume more saturated-fat-rich foods such as red meat and whole-fat dairy.\nThe dietary guidelines inform U.S. nutrition policy, shaping dozens of federal feeding programs, including meals for the military and school lunches. In a statement, the American Academy of Pediatrics hailed the guidance as focused on whole foods for kids. “We commend the [guidelines’] inclusion of the Academy’s evidence-based policy related to breastfeeding, introduction of solid foods, caffeine avoidance and limits on added sugars,” said AAP president Andrew Racine.\nYet the new guidelines’ inclusion of red meat and animal fats contradict decades’ worth of past recommendations and scientific evidence that had directed people to eat less saturated fats and more unsaturated fats, such as those found in olive oil. In one section, however, the guidance recommends that no more than 10 percent of a person’s calories should come from saturated fats and states that “significantly limiting highly processed foods will help meet this goal.” In response to Scientific American, an HHS spokesperson said that the 10 percent cap on saturated fats remained unchanged from previous guidance. That said, in supplemental material reporting the review of evidence, the ne",

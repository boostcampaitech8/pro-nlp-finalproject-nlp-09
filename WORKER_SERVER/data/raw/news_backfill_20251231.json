Even with China buying more U.S. soybean exports, South American production is expected to be strong with little in the way of hostile weather to derail those crops. U.S. farmers are also expected to plant more soybeans, in part in reaction to soybeans finishing 2025 with a better performance than corn or wheat. \"Analysts are currently calling bean plantings up anywhere from 4 to 6 million acres,\" said Charlie Sernatinger of Marex in a note.\nLight Work: Grain futures stayed mixed throughout Wednesday. Outside of speculation around 2026 supply-and-demand fundamentals, prices continue to be moved by geopolitical flashpoints. \"Black Sea fighting continues to rage on but that risk is mostly offset by Taiwan and U.S.-China relations, at least in the grain market's eyes,\" said Matt Zeller of StoneX in a note. \"Little other fundamental news is available.\"\nINSIGHT\nPhoto Finish: The average rate of ethanol production in the last week of December returned to historically high levels, the EIA said.

It is one of several excellent articles written by graduate students in Prof. Janzen’s ACE 527 class in advanced agricultural price analysis this fall.\nChina relies heavily on soybean imports to meet domestic livestock feed demand. China imports around 100 million tons of soybeans each year, more than 90% of which come from the U.S. and Brazil. For the U.S., China typically accounts for more than half of U.S. soybean exports, equivalent to roughly one-quarter of total U.S. production in recent years. For Brazil, the dependency is even more pronounced: about 70–80% of Brazil’s soybean exports are destined for China. Changes in China’s demand therefore have substantial impacts on global soybean prices.\nBecause global soybean production and use are concentrated in a relatively limited number of countries, China, Brazil, and the U.S. are all relatively exposed to soybean market risks stemming from geopolitical tensions, logistical disruptions, and shifts in trade policy. Governments and industry in each country are actively trying to manage this trade-related risk. Policy discussions in this area often focus on making soybean supply chains more ‘resilient’, often through greater self-sufficiency. Brazil and the U.S., as exporters, try to boost domestic demand, for example using subsidies and mandates for bio",

        "all_text": "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Farmers are now learning how much aid they can expect to receive from a $12 billion package that President Donald Trump announced earlier this month.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture released the figures Wednesday for how much aid per acre farmers can plan on for each row crop. The details arrived after most farmers have already met with their bankers to arrange financing for next year’s crops and placed orders for the seed and fertilizer they will need. But officials have promised that the payments should arrive by the end of February.\nSoybean farmers have been hit especially hard by Trump’s trade war with China, which stopped buying any American crops after Trump announced his tariffs this spring. China is the world’s largest buyer of soybeans. This aid package is expected to help farmers weather the trade disruptions until China buys more soybeans under an agreement announced in October and until provisions of Trump’s massive budget bill take effect later this year.\nSoybean farmers will get $30.88 per acre while corn farmers will receive $44.36 per acre. Another crop hit hard when China stopped buying was sorghum, and those farmers will get $48.11 per acre. The amounts are based on a USDA formula on the cost of production.\nFarmers say they need more buyers for their crops\nBut farmers say the aid won’t solve all their problems as they continue to deal with the soaring costs of fertilizer, seeds and labor that make it hard to turn a profit right now.

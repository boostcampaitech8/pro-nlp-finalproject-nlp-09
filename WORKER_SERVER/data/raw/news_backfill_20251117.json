Behind that short-covering are rumors that China has bought more U.S. grain exports out of the Pacific Northwest. However, this hasn't been officially confirmed--and it may not take long for traders to reverse their course. \"We have been getting rumors of the Chinese kicking PNW tires for the last week and have bubkiss to show for it so far,\" said Charlie Sernatinger of Marex in a note. \"Without actual sales, we could see wheat begin to leak lower once again.\"\nPromises Made: Soybeans were propelled Monday by comments from President Trump over the weekend that China will show up as a large buyer of U.S. soybeans later on in the marketing year. This comes after Friday's report from the USDA showed minimal export sales of U.S. soybeans to China during the course of the government shutdown--a number that was then reduced further in a correction by the USDA this morning.\nINSIGHT\nBehind Pace: Shipments of soybeans inspected by the USDA continue to drag behind the pace of this time last year.

She also noted that 500,000 people were receiving two SNAP payments, and in one extreme case, a single Social Security number ",

Interestingly, chickpea protein quality is considered superior to many other pulses, providing essential amino acids and bioactive peptides with various health benefits. According to a study, they also provide significant amounts of dietary fiber (about 12.5–12.8 g per cup cooked), which supports digestive health. And they are also rich in iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, zinc, copper, and selenium. The USDA recommends adults to consume 10-35% of their daily calories from protein, which translates to roughly 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. So, if you are a vegetarian and looking for options to amp up your daily protein intake, try these ten high-protein chickpea dishes which are very easy to make at home.\nIt is one of the most famous chickpeas dishes and is a classic North Indian curry where chickpeas are simmered in a spicy tomato-onion gravy along with garam masala.

The transaction instantly wiped out around $6.05 million in value.\nWith only thin on-chain depth available, the order ripped the stablecoin’s price to nearly $1.26 on Cardano DEXs, according to CoinGecko. USDA briefly floated above peg before retracing to roughly $1.04, as liquidity normalized once the whale-sized order finished clearing.\nThe address had no prior history with USDA, making it unclear whether the user misclicked, confused the stablecoin ticker, or assumed liquidity would hold for a market-order style swap. A mistaken ticker choice is plausible — USDA is not widely traded, and the Cardano ecosystem has multiple USD-denominated assets with similar tickers.\nThe episode is a textbook example of why large traders avoid illiquid pools and never route size through automated market makers without slippage check",

        "all_text": "The longest government shutdown in American history is over. President Donald Trump has signed into law legislation that will fully fund USDA and the FDA through the rest of the new fiscal year. Agri-Pulse Newsmakers asked Tennessee Rep. John Rose about why the new continuing resolution is important for agriculture. He also shared his thoughts on what’s at stake for agriculture in a ruling from the Supreme Court over whether the president properly used a 1977 law to impose tariffs on countries across the globe.\nThen, Tom Sell with Combest, Sell & Associates and Anne MacMillan with Invariant discussed when they think the remaining parts of the farm bill will pass and the measure will look like. They also talked about whether it will be harder to get other countries to lower barriers on American ag exports if the Supreme Court rules against the president.\nWatch the Episode\nWant to receive Newsmakers in your inbox every week?

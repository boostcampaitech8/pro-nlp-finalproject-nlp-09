Inbound shipments have risen by almost a quarter so far in 2025 from a year earlier, the group’s data showed.\nPrices in India have been hovering at about $40 to $50 a ton below comparable South American offers, a gap that has made imports increasingly uneconomic, Acharya said in an interview. “If the disparity continues, there will be a washout of more volume,” he said.\nIndia’s edible oil trade is witnessing a change as fresh arrivals from the new local crop and weaker demand, mainly due to the absence of festivals and a pause in Hindu weddings during an ongoing inauspicious period, make imports less viable. Some traders are scrapping short-term deals and booking supplies further out, instead.\nAt the same time, Argentina prices have risen as it fulfills soybean sales commitments to China, tightening availability.

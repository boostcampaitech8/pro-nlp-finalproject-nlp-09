The at-risk product is the company’s 16-oz. (1-lb.) vacuum-sealed packages of FORWARD FARMS GRASS-FED GROUND BEEF. The packages have a use or freeze by date of 01/13/26. The product also has the establishment number EST 2083 printed on the side of the package.\nThe meat was shipped to six states, including California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Pennsylvania, and Washington to be sold. The USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) advises customers to check their freezers for the at-risk products and either throw them away immediately or return them to the place of purchase. There have been no confirmed reports of illnesses due to the contaminated product.\nPer the announcement, the possible contamination was flagged during a routine FSIS testing, which discovered the presence of E. coli O26. “Most people infected with STEC O26 develop diarrhea (often bloody) and vomiting,” the release said.\nHow do you treat E.coli?\nAccording to Mayo Clinic, rest and fluids are the most common treatments for an E. coli infection. Those with the illness should avoid anti-diarrheal medications which can slow digestion and healing. Likewise, antibiotics aren’t recommended. It also notes that sometimes E. coli can lead to a life-threatening form of kidney failure, which requires hospi",

The increase is driven by a 0.8% year-over-year increase in market hogs, also expected to be 0.9% lower, while the breeding herd decreased by 0.9% from the prior year, compared to expectations of 1.2% lower. Still, that’s the smallest Dec. 1 breeding herd since 2014.\nThe 180-pound-and-over weight class of market hogs is up 2.8% from a year ago, compared to expectations of just 0.5% higher, while the 120-to-179-pound group is up about 0.6%, which places some downward pressure on near-term prices; though much of the heaviest class has already gone to slaughter. The under-50-pounds and 50-to-119 pounds weight classes, respectively, are up 1.0% and down 0.9%, from last year. Still, there are just 0.3% more hogs weighing under 180 pounds than a year ago, compared to expectations of 1.2% lower, which will arrive at processing plants from January to May 2026, implying similar supplies as last year for the period overall.\nThe unanticipated increase in inventory of the lightest category of market hogs stems from the unexpectedly higher September-November pig crop, up 0.4% from a year ago in contrast to expectations of 1.3% lower, reflecting a 0.3% increase in sows farrowed and a record 11.93 pigs-per-litter for the period just surpassing the prior r",

Kennedy Jr. and USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins as the department announced a new $700 million investment in regenerative agriculture.\nGiven recent history, skepticism is understandable. Cuts to farm-to-school lunch programs, the rollback of farmer grants funded under the Inflation Reduction Act, and a longstanding lack of consistent support for small and mid-sized family farms have left many producers wary of federal promises. I understand the doubt. Many farmers have learned, the hard way, to expect little.\nStill, this moment matters.\nAs someone who followed RFK Jr. to the White House, I have remained clear-eyed about the limits of his authority at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Agriculture policy does not sit within HHS, and his portfolio is already full. Yet Kennedy has long understood the opportunity that regenerative agriculture presents, not just for farmers but also for public health, environmental resilience, and food quality.\nThat understanding helped inspire Kelly Ryerson, Rick Clark, and me to co-found American Regeneration, an organization created to educate, inform, and influence this administration, particularly within the MAHA ecos",

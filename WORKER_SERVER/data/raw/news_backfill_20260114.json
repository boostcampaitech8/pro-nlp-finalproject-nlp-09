As I checked the pre-dawn news, this term was used a number of times as an answer to Tuesday’s question of if Metals are being driven higher by safe-haven buying only. One of the headlines on CNBC.com Wednesday morning was, “Resource nationalism could propel gold to $5,000 and silver to $100 this year”. What is “resource national”? I asked Al, as in Bundy, also known as AI (Artificial Intelligence), and the algorithm replied with, “when a government asserts greater control over its natural resources for economic, strategic, or political reasons”. Recall I talked about gold at 5K last fall, though silver took center stage late in the year. Overnight saw the March issue (SIH26) take out $90 on its way to an all-time high (so far) of $91.37, up $5.03 (5.8%). Within the CNBC story was the tidbit “China placed export controls on the metal in December”, part of why silver acted like a short-supply market last month.

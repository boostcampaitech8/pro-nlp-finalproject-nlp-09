About 80% of those ― 359 ― were the result of the incentive program. Another 53 resigned.\nNationally, attrition ranged from below 10% in some sub-agencies to as much as 67% in others, said the report. More than 30% of staff left the National Agricultural Statistics Service, the Nati",

The funding will also go toward emergency standby systems, replacing lead elements in service lines and building hydrants and main lines through parts of the city.\nThe city of Ricketts received smaller grants and loans through the same Water and Waste Disposal Loans and Grants program to line its sewers, seal manholes and build a new discharge lagoon for its wastewater treatment system. The city received a $200,000 loan and a $900,000 grant for the improvements.\nIowa Regional Utilities received $650,000 total in grants and loans to build the firs",

Both were identified early, with limited spread to other farms,\" Patton said. \"These events involved the D1.1 strain.\"\nBird flu in the Wisconsin herd was also detected through the strategy, and represents a new, separate spillover event and involves the D1.1 strain, Patton said. The D 1.1 sequence appears in the wild bird population.\nPatton stressed that the strain of virus that sickened poultry farms is not the same as the one affecting dairy cattle.\n\"There are lots of d.1 that are very distinct and different and far enough apart that those mutations are not going to be a source for that [Dodge County",

The approved $37.5 million will help fund repair, restoration and stabilization of local streams and streambanks after damage from Tropical Storm Helene.\nAt this time, the county is working to secure additional funds to fully carry out the program. Staff are also completing the contracting process and working with property owners to sign and return their right of entry if they have not already done so.\nOnce all contracts are in place and additional funding is secured, the county will issue a request for qualifications to find engineering services for the project design and implementation. Expected completion time for the program is two to five years due to the number of sites and complexity of the projects.\n\"Staff is working diligently through the processes and appreciates the patience and cooperation of all involved,\" the release said.\nOver the course of the program’s initial stages, a 46-person team of Buncombe County Soil and Water Conservation District staff and partners from across the state conducted 492 site visits an",

To paraphrase the Arthashastra, ‘The primary duty of the sovereign is to ensure a full granary for the citizens.’ And this is not possible without a prosperous farmer.\nCharan Singh and the smallholder farmer\nIndia’s march to self-sufficiency in food is directly linked to Charan Singh’s strong belief in the capability of smallholder agriculture to address the issue of food security. However, not much is known about his stiff opposition to the proposed farm collectivisation resolution adopted in the 1959 Congress session at Nagpur. In the session, he crossed swords with none other than his own party helmsman and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru on the issue of ‘collective farms’ in the name of co-operative farming. Nehru and the Planning Commission were hell–bent on introducing the collectivisation model adopted by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of China.\nA contemporary witness to the proceedings, former President Giani Zail Singh recorded:\n“[Charan Singh] vigorously opposed the Collective Farming proposal brought by Panditji. I was spellbound by Chaudhary Saheb’s hour-long fluent speech. Panditji listened carefully to Chaudhary Saheb powerful speech, and even smiled.

Louisiana experienced the greatest absolute decline, with agricultural exports to China down $1.85 billion, largely due to a 48% drop in soybean shipments through Gulf ports. Washington followed with a $1.36 billion decrease, also driven primarily by reduced soybean exports.\nOther major exporting states saw similarly sharp drops. Texas exports fell by 80%, with coarse grain shipments to China disappearing entirely. California, historically a key exporter of high-value specialty crops, lost $808 million, led by an 89% drop in tree nut exports. Illinois, another soybean powerhouse, saw total agricultural exports to China fall 67%, resulting in a $545 million loss.\nSouthern states tied to cotton were also hit particularly hard. Tennessee, Georgia, Mississippi and Virginia all reported total declines between 62% and 92%, with cotton identified as the most affected product in each case. Midwestern states like Nebraska and Kansas suffered steep cuts in beef and coarse grain exports, respectively. In Oregon, wheat exports to China halted entirely.\nOnly a handful of states saw gains. Michigan led with a $11.3 million increase, driven by increases in soups and prepared foods, followed by smaller upticks in Vermont, New Jer",

In its previous report issued in August, USDA had projected a trade deficit of $41.5 billion this fiscal year.\nThe U.S. recorded trade deficits of around $32 billion in FY2024 and $17 billion in FY2023, respectively.\nThe quarterly trade forecast, published by the Economic Research Service, had been scheduled for publication last month, but was delayed due to the government shutdown.\nDriving the adjusted outlook are larger-than-expected exports. USDA now expects $173 billion in ag exports for FY2026, up from the $169 projected in August. But even with the revision, exports are still set to contract year-over-year, after the U.S. recorded $175.6 billion in exports in FY2025.\nAg imports are also set to fall from $219.4 billion during the last fiscal year to $210 billion in FY2026.\nThe FY2026 outlook is buoyed by stronger grain and feed, oilseed and dairy exports than previously estimated. Corn exports, for example, were initially forecast to hit $15.2 billion, but projections have been revised to $17.6 billion for the fiscal year. Soybean export estimates were also revised up in Tuesday’s release from $18.3 billion to $19 billion.\nU.S. dairy export projections grew by $400 million from August’s estima",

In that report, the USDA forecast farm income at $179.8 billion for 2025, a 41% increase over the previous year. However, over $40 billion of that would come from direct government payouts, which would be a more than $30 billion increase from 2024.\nThe number is also supported by strong returns for livestock producers, with inflation-adjusted animal and animal-product cash receipts forecast to grow by 8.4%, or $23.2 billion. Meanwhile, cash receipts for crop sales were projected to fall by 5%, or $12.3 billion.\nThis week, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said the Trump administration would release a plan for new \"bridge payments\" for U.S. farmers next week, in an effort to offset financial losses from tariffs a",

The states have argued that the information being requested is private, and that handing it over would be a violation of privacy laws.\nOn Tuesday, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins addressed the issue at a Cabinet meeting. Rollins said that cooperation from all 50 states is necessary in order “to root out this fraud and to protect the American taxpayer,” doubling down on previous statements alleging that SNAP benefits are going to people who should not be receiving them, or the deceased. “We’ve arrested more than 120 people with SNAP fraud,” Rollins said in a recent News Nation interview.\nA USDA spokesperson said, per Newsweek, “USDA established a SNAP integrity team to analyze not only data provided by states, but to scrub all available information to end indiscriminate welfare fraud. 28 States and Guam joined us in this fight; but states like California, New York, and Minnesota, among 19 other blue States, keep fighting us.”\nWhile fraud in the program has been a frequent talking point from the USDA, there isn’t a lot of research to back the claim that SNAP fraud is widespread.

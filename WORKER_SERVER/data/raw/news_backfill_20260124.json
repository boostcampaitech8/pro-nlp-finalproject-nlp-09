However, given the manufactured reaction by the noncommercial side, the price range did change. At least for now.\nThis Weekly Column will be different than most. There won’t be any little puns, or pop culture references, or song lyrics. There is time for having some fun with commentary, and there is time to be serious. As we get set to sail on a new week, we are left with the latter, as the manufactured meltdown of one of the most important markets in US agriculture changed the playing field. A number of years ago, the theme of my Outlook presentation at the annual Ag Summit was “The Domino Effect”. I talked about if the corn market was the first domino to fall, then eventually the rest of US agriculture would follow. Though I’m not a fan of USDA’s WASDE reports, particularly this past week, for comparison of projected units to be exported, as opposed to gross value, we saw:\nCorn estimated at 81.28 million metric tons (mmt)\nSoybeans at 42.86 mmt\nAll wheat at 24.49 mmt\nSoybean meal at 17.6 mmt\nCotton at 12.2 mmt\nPork at 3.2 mmt\nBeef at 1.1 mmt\nA quick look at this list and we see US corn exports nearly equal the next 6 markets added together.

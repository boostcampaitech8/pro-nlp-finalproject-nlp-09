Over the past year I visited farmers and ranchers in over half of the states, and I heard firsthand how grateful they are for this administration’s decisive actions on their behalf.\nEarly 2025 saw us immediately working to curb highly pathogenic avian influenza. Our aim was to both better protect the poultry sector and lower egg prices for everyday consumers. A year later, we have surpassed expectations, as the industry has stabilized and egg prices have dropped more than 80 percent.\nWithin months the president signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act—lowering taxes for farmers by a projected $10 billion or more. The bill permanently eliminated the death tax and made permanent ",

If “King Corn” stabilizes, other grain markets will also have better chances to begin their own price uptrends.\nLast week’s USDA’s production figures included both record harvested acres of 91.3 million and a record average yield of 186.5 bushels per acre. U.S. corn producers may also be looking toward the 2026-27 crop year that could present another year of hefty U.S. corn acres planted.\nStrong export demand for U.S. corn continues to surface. USDA last Friday reported daily U.S. corn sales of 120,000 MT of corn to Japan and 298,000 MT to unknown destinations during 2025-26. Demand continues to be the bright spot for corn, as U.S. export business sits at unprecedented levels along with domestic ethanol production.\nFocus is starting to shift toward Brazil’s second-crop corn (safrinha) plantings. Corn and soybean traders are closely watching weather conditions in South American growing regions. There are some dry areas in southern Argentina, but no major problems",

        "all_text": "Attorneys general from 20 Democratic states, plus the District of Columbia, have penned a letter to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) over proposed changes to SNAP eligibility for noncitizens.\nWhy It Matters\nThe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) helps around 42 million low- and no-income Americans and legal non-citizens with affording groceries.\nBut several changes have been implemented recently following the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in July this year, the bedrock of President Donald Trump's domestic spending policy.\nWhat To Know\nThe letter urged the USDA to reconsider guidance issued in October that would bar some permanent resident noncitizens from receiving SNAP benefits.\nSection 10108 of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act changed the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 to bar people who enter the U.S. as refugees, asylees, or humanitarian parolees from receiving SNAP. But the states argue the law does not block those same individuals from becoming eligible later if they obtain lawful permanent resident status.\nIn their letter, the attorneys general argue that the USDA’s new guidance misstates the law by listing refugees, asylees, parolees and people with withheld deportation as outright “not eligible” for SNAP—without noting that they can qualify once they become permanent residents. They also say the agency has wrongly suggested that humanitarian entrants must wait five years after gaining permanent residency to receive benefits, even thoug",

        "all_text": "The second phase of a disaster relief program approved by Congress last year will especially benefit specialty crop growers, according to USDA Undersecretary for Farm Production and Conservation Richard Fordyce.\nWhile the first phase of the Supplemental Disaster Relief Program focused on providing aid to insured producers for crop losses, the second phase will also allow assistance to non-insured producers or producers that saw \"shallow\" losses that did not trigger an indemnity, Fordyce said on Agri-Pulse Newsmakers. He believes a \"high percentage\" of phase two applicants will be specialty crop growers.\nUSDA announced the opening of SDRP phase two on Monday.\n\"It's going to be a help for folks that didn't get an indemnity,\" Fordyce said, noting that for specialty crop growers in particular, crop insurance products are often not available or don't work well.\nUSDA used 2023 and 2024 crop insurance data to help determine phase one assistance eligibility, which means it would have targeted insured producers. Phase two, on the other hand, will focus on losses that did not exceed producers' crop insurance deductibles.\nWhen asked about the status of a potential program to assist farmers with trade-related losses, Fordyce said conversations are \"ongoing.\"\nHe said Trump administration officials want to make sure it is \"reflective of what's actually happening in the marketplace,\" before rolling it out. He noted that on top of commodity prices, producers are also struggling with high inp",

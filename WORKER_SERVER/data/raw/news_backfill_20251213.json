Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like it is bringing much precipitation with many areas increasingly drought stressed. We have seen quite a bit of snowfall in the Midwest and Northeast recently, but it has not been broad in coverage. The Pacific Northwest has received heavy rainfall in select regions as of late.\nAfter this cold spell, there is a dramatic shift back to warmer temperatures that look to last through Christmas. Perhaps that is the explanation behind the apocalyptic plunge in natural gas futures that from last Friday’s high at $5.496 on January futures to this Friday’s low at $4.065, has lost an incredible $1.431 in one week! They don’t call this contract the ‘widow-maker’ for nothing and this week’s trading range has reinforced this reputation.\nHowever, EIA’s weekly natural gas storage update released every Thursday revealed that net withdrawals were larger than expected, larger than a year ago and larger than the 5-year average! All of that is bullish with LNG exports strong. Buy the rumor, sell the fact? Apparently and I would expect to see a strong rebound as demand remains on solid footing.\nThe warmup following this cold snap sure doesn't bode well for freezing out those New World Screwworms in Mexican cattle should the USDA reopen the border.

Announced by Agriculture Secretary Brooke L. Rollins alongside Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Regenerative Pilot Program represents a major financial and philosophical investment in rebuilding soil health. The administration positions this not merely as a conservation effort, but as a foundational step in President Trump’s “Make America Healthy Again” (MAHA) agenda, arguing that the health of the nation’s population is inextricably tied to the health of its soil.\nRoots in crisis: The historical imperative for soil conservation\nThe federal government’s focus on soil health is not new; it was born from catastrophe.
